# Enhanced Notes

Have you ever forgotten to write down a definition or not had enough time jot one down before the teacher moves on? Introducing Enhanced Notes, an easy-to-use web app that converts custom Markdown-esque syntax into useful context and information.

## OCR(+)
Traditional optical character recognition (OCR) has always been used for document scanning, but our implementation is able to detect handwritten, printed, and screenshotted notes - all while detecting our custom syntax.
 - Backend available at 

## Syntax
To get more information and context surrounding a term or event, surround it in `/` marks.

```
/Weltpolitik/
```

## Enhancment
Once uploaded to the web app, an enhanced version will be returned after processing.
```
[Weltpolitik : Weltpolitik (German: [ˈvɛltpoliˌtiːk], "world politics") was the imperialist foreign policy adopted by the German Empire during the reign of Emperor Wilhelm II.]
```

## Potential

 - Direct Onenote, Evernote, etc. integration
 - More enhancements
   - Formula
   - Chemical equation balancing
   - Date
   - Image
   - Equation solution
   - Synonym
   - Antonym
 - Full Web Dashboard
 - Android App Client
